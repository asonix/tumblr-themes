#Theme02

[example](http://asonix-dev.tumblr.com/)


This is my second theme. As you might be able to tell, I was mostly just trying to mimic the gitlab UI.

###There are three varients out-of-the-box:

>Light Varient (default)

>Darker Varient

![theme-02-3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asonix/tumblr-themes/master/theme02/theme-02-3.png)
>Dark Varient

###When the window is smaller, the sidebar collapses to save space:

>Collapsing Sidebar

###When there is no selected post, the log takes up the full width of the page:
![theme-02-4.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asonix/tumblr-themes/master/theme02/theme-02-4.png)
>Light Varient

![theme-02-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asonix/tumblr-themes/master/theme02/theme-02-5.png)
>Darker Varient

![theme-02-6.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asonix/tumblr-themes/master/theme02/theme-02-6.png)
>Dark Varient

The color of the link text, and the color of the sidebar can be easily changed.
Please do not remove the theme credit.
