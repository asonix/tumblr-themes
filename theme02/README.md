#Theme02

[example](http://asonix-dev.tumblr.com/)


This is my second theme. As you might be able to tell, I was mostly just trying to mimic the gitlab UI.

There are three varients out-of-the-box

>Darker Varient

>Dark Varient

The color of the link text, and the color of the sidebar can be easily changed.
Please do not remove the theme credit.
